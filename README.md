# The integrality gap of the Traveling Salesman Problem is 4/3 if the LP solution has at most n+6 non-zero components


This repository contains the code and data used in the paper:
_The integrality gap of the Traveling Salesman Problem is 4/3
if the LP solution has at most n+6 non-zero components_.

The paper itself is included as ```paper.pdf```.


## Project Structure

The project is structures as follows.


- ```.```\
  The main directory stores modules with methods useful to reproduce the results of the paper:
  - ```stsp.py```
    implements the main methods for the symmetric traveling salesman problem;
  - ```ancestors.py```
    implements a simple method to check whether a vertex is an ancestor;
  - ```optII.py```
    implements a procedure to solve OPTII;
  - ```bbmove.py```
    implements the BB-move and the associated construction of new walks;
  - ```GB_algorithm.py```
    implements the GB and GBe algorithms.

- ```vertices```\
  Contains ```txt``` files of the vertices: these are found on [Sylvia Boyd's website](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~sylvia/subtourvertices/index.htm).

- ```ancestors```\
  Contains ```csv``` files of the ancestors.

- ```prod```\
  Contains modules for the production of the results presented in the paper.

## How to run the code

To reproduce the results of the paper, you can run the scripts in the ```prod``` directory:
- ```retrieve_ancestors.py``` retrieves the ancestors from the vertices and stores them in the ```ancestors``` directory;
- ```apply_GBe_algorithm.py``` applies the GBe algorithm to the ancestors and stores the results in the ```output``` directory.

Before running the scripts, make sure to have the required packages installed.
They are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file and may be installed running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notice that, since the scripts use ```gurobypy``` to solve the linear programs, a Gurobi license is needed:
consult the [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/licensing/) for more information on how to obtain one.\
We used a Gurobi license for academic purposes, version 11.0.0.
